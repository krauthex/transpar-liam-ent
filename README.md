# transpar-liam-ent

This is a WIP; ideally, it will provide a tool to properly scrape the contents of the "Parlamentarische Anfragen" website of the Austrian parliament (see [here](https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/JMAB/)).

The reason behind it is that the website itself is relatively annoying to use, and provides very poor search functionality, i.e. no full-text search nor a direct search for inquierer and receiver.

Currently, this is merely a collection of very rudimentary functions.
